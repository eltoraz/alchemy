As ideas start to come together more, this will be more like a proper roadmap with plans for each release, etc.
It'll probably be better off as a wiki page once I open a Github repo for the project.
But for now it's mostly just a braindump of things I'm working on/figuring out now.
Using [this page of the comic](http://floraverse.com/comic/flora/page/208-basic-guide-to-magic/) as a starting point.

### The gist of it

Mixing/cooking/processing reagents together yields a potion dependent on:
- combined concentrations of elements in ingredients
- special properties possessed by rare/otherwise important ingredients
- ambient/environmental factors (magical artifacts, affinity of player/NPC assistants in close proximity)

### Elemental interaction

A couple ways to handle mixing elements from reagents:
- combine them to form the given secondary/tertiary element with a concentration relative to the constituents
- have the resultant concoction retain the elements of the reagents (perhaps with a slight loss from processing)

The second could possibly incorporate the first via a separate mechanism - a process to promote elements combining.
Which would be less complex overall? The first has more to keep in mind from the start (elemental combinatorics).
The second has more moving parts but seems like a shallower learning curve to introduce.

### Potion types and effects

Not limited to drinkable concoctions!
Including but not limited to potions, salves, poisons, volatile mixtures (explosive/corrosive/otherwise damaging on contact).
The important thing is having a wide variety of mundane and more interesting effects since this is a core gameplay element.

- healing (raw health recovery and regen)
- generic antidotes for various poisons, as well as specialized antidotes for rarer/more virulent ones
- general panacea for common but weak ailments
- resist X element
- resist X environmental factor (e.g., extreme heat but not necessarily Fire)
- boost abilities of X element
- temporary boost to specific physical abilities
- temporary boost to specialized skills
- "vanilla"/physical poison
- "magical" poison (specifically target foes' elemental weakness)
- supress magical abilities
- illumination
- sense/perception enhancers (night vision, sense magic, etc.)
- "pheromone" concoctions - use to alter behavior of other creatures
- explosives (e.g., detonates on contact with a specific substance/elemental influence)
- corrosive mixtures (traditional acid, but also specialized ones that act on targeted substances or magic types)
- waterbreathing
- berserk
- stun
- slow
- haste
- perhaps not a true invisibility but a chameleon-like camouflage effect
