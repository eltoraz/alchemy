### Protagonist

- name: Acacia  
- species: (undecided, preference for something w/ avian and/or reptilian features)  
- gender: female  
- age: young adult  
- affinity: (determined in-game?)  

Need to decide on species, esp. one that will reasonably fit with the native locales

#### Background

- born in Mew York City (causing malleable affinity)

- moved to Stemm, Citrico Archipelago, with family as a young teen

- applied to and was indefinitely waitlisted at Kadath's university, so studied potionmaking and alchemy at Citrico Capital's univerity instead

- works at parents' potion shop in Stemm, but isn't necessarily satisfied with the retail aspect

- at the same time, is more than a little intimidated by the dangers of fieldwork
