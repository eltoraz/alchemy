### Protagonist

- name: Acacia
- species: coralshell turtle
- gender: female
- age: young adult
- affinity: Water/Clay (weak)

#### Background and motivation (game 1: text adventure)

- born in Mew York City
    - mother: coralshell turtle (Clay affinity)
    - father: frilled petal dragon (Water affinity, some coralshell turtle ancestry)
    - with this parentage, Acacia's coral is more plant-like and faster-growing
      than pure coralshell turtles
    - weak initial affinity partially due to being born in Mew York's lack of
      native magic and partially due to quirks of parents' affinities

- moved to Stemm, Citrico Archipelago, with family as a young teen
    - parents were hit by economic hardship and had to liquidate in Mew York,
      but managed to keep their small vacation home

- applied to and was effectively indefinitely waitlisted at Kadath's university,
  so studied potionmaking/alchemy at Citrico Capital's univerity instead
    - a couple years after moving
    - coasted through without finding a specialty/passion; graduated easily
    - moved back home afterwards... but that was a little more than a year ago

- works at mother's bookshop in Stemm
    - it's nice always having something to read, but having to put down a good
      book to help a customer can be irksome
    - and being constantly cheerful is rather tiring!
    - no storage space at home, so her old college supplies, incl. alchemy
      apparati, are in a (surprisingly roomy) closet out in the back of the shop

- building frustration with her life inspires her to try to figure out how to
  actually use her education - even starting a simple potion shop would be
  preferable to the current stagnation
    - but after paying off her student loans she doesn't exactly have captial
      to foot the necessary business expenses
    - fieldwork would be much cheaper, even after acquiring the necessary permits,
      but dealing with the wildlife can be dangerous...
