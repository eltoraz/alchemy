### Protagonist

- name: [] (she/her)
- species: turtle
- age: young adult
- affinity: Water (weak), Earth (weak)

#### Background and motivations

- born in suburbs of a big city
    - mother: turtle (Earth affinity)
    - father: floral dragon (Water & Earth affinity)
    - fringes of her shell grow out, but are brittle and break away painlessly 
        - the pieces do have some alchemical value, but
          their properties have escaped classification thus far (and no one has had
          the inclination to do more extensive testing on it)
    - weak initial affinity is environmental- childhood home city had low ambient magic

- famliy was hit by economic hardship with parents as a young teen, had to move to
  a less expensive area
    - wound up with a small homestead close to a village on a medium-size island
      in an archipelago
    - her mother took a job at a small bookshop (eventually taking over when the
      owners moved on to other pursuits)
    - her father took an interest in local politics, but was drawn in to the point
      of being absent at home

- applied to and was effectively indefinitely waitlisted at a prestigious magic
  university on the mainland, so studied potionmaking/alchemy at a local school
    - applied a couple years after moving
    - her parents separated (amicably) during this time
    - coasted through without finding a specialty/passion; took a variety of
      classes in different disciplines but without a lot of depth
    - moved back home afterwards... but that was a little more than a year ago

- works at mother's bookshop, with this kind of mindset:
    - she has developed a convincing "customer service" facade but doesn't
      experience much in the way of personal fulfillment from this day job
    - it's nice always having something to read, but having to put down a good
      book to help a customer can be irksome
    - and being constantly cheerful is rather tiring!
    - no storage space at home, so her old college supplies, incl. alchemy
      apparati, are in a closet out in the back of the shop
        - one that could, say, be converted into a makeshift lab...

- motivated by building frustration with what she perceives as stagnation with
  the direction her life is heading
    - she isn't using the education she invested so much time (and money, can't
      forget about the student loans!) in
    - her experience working retail isn't exactly making her eager to work in a
      potion shop though, and she didn't take an apprenticeship while at university
      to give her the experience to leapfrog her into a more senior position
    - an independent position appeals to her, and the fieldwork would be much
      cheaper, even after acquiring the necessary permits, but dealing with the
      wildlife can be dangerous...
    - it's a daunting prospect, and it's a project she's had trouble figuring out
      how to even start
