### Protagonist

- name: Acacia
- species: coralshell turtle
- gender: female
- age: young adult
- affinity: undefined

#### Background and motivation (game 1: text adventure)

- born in Mew York City (accounting for the lack of hereditary affinity)
    - mother: coralshell turtle
    - father: frilled petal dragon-coralshell turtle hybrid (ATM unsure whether
      he leans more towards the characteristics of one or the other)
    - with this parentage, Acacia's coral is more plant-like and faster-growing
      than pure coralshell turtles

- moved to Stemm, Citrico Archipelago, with family as a young teen
    - it was a small vacation home, but they made do since they needed to sell
      their Mew York home...

- applied to and was effectively indefinitely waitlisted at Kadath's university,
  so studied potionmaking/alchemy at Citrico Capital's univerity instead
    - coasted through without finding a specialty/passion; graduated easily
    - moved back home afterwards... but that was a little more than a year ago

- works at mother's bookshop in Stemm
    - it's nice always having something to read, but having to put down a good
      book to help a customer can be irksome
    - and being constantly cheerful is rather tiring!
    - no storage space at home, so her old college supplies, incl. alchemy
      apparati, are in a (surprisingly roomy) closet out in the back of the shop

- building frustration with her life inspires her to try to figure out how to
  actually use her education - even starting a simple potion shop would be
  preferable to the current stagnation
    - but after paying off her student loans she doesn't exactly have captial
      to foot the necessary business expenses
    - fieldwork would be much cheaper, even after acquiring the necessary permits,
      but dealing with the wildlife can be dangerous...
