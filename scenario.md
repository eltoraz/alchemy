### Protagonist

- name: Acacia
- species: coralshell turtle
- gender: female
- age: young adult
- affinity: Water/Clay (weak)

#### Background and motivation

- born in Mew York City
    - mother: coralshell turtle (Clay affinity)
    - father: frilled petal dragon (Water affinity, some coralshell turtle ancestry)
    - the FPD parentage makes Acacia's coral more plant-like and faster-growing
      than pure coralshell turtles
        - like many coralshell turtles, hers does have some alchemical value, but
          its properties have escaped classification thus far (and no one has had
          the inclination to do more extensive testing on it)
    - weak initial affinity partially due to native Mew York's lack of
      ambient magic and partially due to quirks of parents' affinities

- moved to Stemm, Citrico Archipelago, with parents as a young teen
    - they were hit by economic hardship and had to liquidate in Mew York, but
      settled debts and kept their small vacation home
    - her mother took a job at a small bookshop (eventually taking over when the
      owners moved on to other pursuits)
    - her father took an interest in local politics, especially as the frequent
      commutes to the Capital allowed him to visit his daughter at university

- applied to and was effectively indefinitely waitlisted at Kadath's university,
  so studied potionmaking/alchemy at Citrico Capital's univerity instead
    - applied a couple years after moving
    - her parents separated (amicably) during this time
    - coasted through without finding a specialty/passion; took a variety of
      classes in different disciplines but without a lot of depth
    - moved back home afterwards... but that was a little more than a year ago

- works at mother's bookshop in Stemm
    - she has developed a convincing "customer service" facade but doesn't
      experience much in the way of personal fulfillment from this day job
    - it's nice always having something to read, but having to put down a good
      book to help a customer can be irksome
    - and being constantly cheerful is rather tiring!
    - no storage space at home, so her old college supplies, incl. alchemy
      apparati, are in a (surprisingly roomy) closet out in the back of the shop
        - one that could, say, be converted into a makeshift lab...

- motivated by building frustration with what she perceives as stagnation with
  the direction her life is heading
    - she isn't using the education she invested so much time (and money, can't
      forget about the student loans!) in
    - her experience working retail isn't exactly making her eager to work in a
      potion shop though, and she didn't take an apprenticeship while at university
      to give her the experience to leapfrog her into a more senior position
    - an independent position appeals to her, and the fieldwork would be much
      cheaper, even after acquiring the necessary permits, but dealing with the
      wildlife can be dangerous...
    - it's a daunting prospect, and it's a project she's had trouble figuring out
      how to even start
