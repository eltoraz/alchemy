Sandbox for gamedev ideas. Current project: some kind of alchemy system. Using Starbound crops for the moment since they were easy enough to extract from the game's assets, and [floraverse's flexible elemental magic system](http://floraverse.deviantart.com/journal/Elements-guide-425648924).

Starbound assets not included. They're easy enough to extract yourself though using the game's [included modding tools](http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?threads/how-to-successfully-pack-and-unpack-pak-files.66649/).
