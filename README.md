Some kind of alchemy system. Using Starbound crops for the moment since they were easy enough to extract from the game's assets,
and collecting seeds for the farm on my home planet was one of the inspirations for this.

Starbound assets not included. They're easy enough to extract yourself though using the game's [included modding tools](http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?threads/how-to-successfully-pack-and-unpack-pak-files.66649/).

[Floraverse's flexible elemental magic system](http://floraverse.deviantart.com/journal/Elements-guide-425648924) fits better
than Starbound's sci-fi setting.

Requires jsonpatch
