Sandbox for gamedev ideas. Current project: some kind of alchemy system. Using Starbound crops for the moment since I'm not sure whether I want to make a Starbound mod or incorporate it into a full-fledged game.

Starbound assets not included. They're easy enough to extract yourself though using the game's [included modding tools](http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?threads/how-to-successfully-pack-and-unpack-pak-files.66649/).
